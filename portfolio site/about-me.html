<div class="about-me">
   <p>Lannie is a rising senior at the University of California, San Diego. She is pursuing a BS in Management Science and a 
      minor in Design and will be graduating Spring 2021.</p>

   <p> A kid at heart, she loves to leverage design in order to save people some of their precious time to get back to doing 
      what they love all while injecting some youth and modernity into her designs.</p>

   <p>Beyond design, she is a big fan of surf punk, a self-taught guitar player, and a California burrito connoisseur.</p>
