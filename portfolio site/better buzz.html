         <h2>Overview</h2>
         <p>After ordering ahead online and running into issues during that ordering process, I realized there was a great 
            design opportunity here to create a mobile app for the coffee shop that would improve the customer experience. 
            This is further necessitated by the ongoing pandemic with more coffee shops, restaurants, and stores offering mobile
            ordering in order to encourage social distancing. Having a mobile app that provides customers with an easy way to 
            order ahead and pick up quickly can help keep business moving as well as help ensure we keep our communities safe.
            In this design, I will be focusing on creating a mobile app for the coffee shop that will provide a smooth, 
            streamlined customer experience that will turn curious coffee fans into regular customers. </p>

         <p>Currently, Better Buzz has no mobile application. Customers order ahead by visiting their website and clicking on 
         the "Order Ahead" button. This redirects you to another site, which can be unappealing to some customers who may be 
         uncomfortable with a third-party processor. The process to order online is somewhat tedious because of the large array 
         of menu items available. While the website does display various headers (Favorite Drinks, Iced Drinks, etc.) to assist in 
         organization, it does little to make navigation 
         easier.</p>

      <div class="user-research">
         <h2> User Research</h2>
         <p> Since there is no current mobile app, I talked to users about the current order ahead function to gain an 
            understanding before designing the app. I can ensure I eliminate any current pain points head on. This resulted in 
            the following takeaways:
         </p>
         <div class="takeaways">
            <p>1. Scrolling through every single menu item is tedious<p>
            <p>2. Inconsistencies in add-ons across different drinks confused users</p>
            <p>3. With no option to create an account and save orders or payments, users are forced to input lots of information
            every time.</p>

               <h3>User Personas</h3>
               <p>From my user research and analysis, I created two user personas with contrasting needs that I believe encompasses
                  many Better Buzz customers.

            <h3>Competitor Benchmark</h3>
            <p>I also took time to research some other competing mobile apps already on the market. This would help inform 
               me as to what sort of standard already exists for mobile ordering with coffee shops. I chose these competitors 
               based on their proximity to Better Buzz as well as their general level of popularity in the area. When 
               researching these apps, I focused largely on each app's information architecture.</p>

               <p>After conducting research on competing apps, I decided on four primary screens - Home, Menu, Profile, and Cart.
               This would allow users to act on existing knowledge and create a more intuitive interface.

               <h3> User Flows</h3>
               <p>Moving further, I created a couple user flows specific to the user personas. This ensures I keep primary users
               in mind as I strive to design an app that is efficient for a variety of users.

               </div>
               <p>The first user flow primarily caters to users like Ozzy. By prioritizing exploration and discoverability, new
               customers can easily explore the menu.

               <p> The second user flow is extremely rewarding for returning customers like Lili; by allowing users to access
               their order history, they can easily order the same drinks again and again.
